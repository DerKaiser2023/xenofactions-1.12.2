# A new fork reviving the OG 1.7.10 factions Mod.

Xenofactions is a modification of the mod "Xradar" a factions mod made by Bobcat for the "Tyrants and Plebians" war server. It is primarily for our own server "Ragecraft" but is here for all to download aswell. 

## List of changes
- Fixes to various broken commands, like /c apply (now can be used without admin permissions)
- By default the FMU+ radars are disabled for compatiblity with Mcheli
- Updated stone drop logic, allowing for modded ores (can be customized via json or commands)
- ...and many more to come. 
- fixed bobs stupid ass shops saving to world file instead of using a JSON like a non schizophrenic developer 
- added a custom image block so players can do custom graffiti/images
- adds allying and improvements to fundamental flag logic

All we ask is that you give credit to either "Ragex", "The Swamp", or "Swag Gang" if you use this mod for your own 1.7.10 war server. Enjoy!


# NOTICE:

Don't ask me for help making modpacks. I'm not going to help you make a modpack. Stop asking. Stop opening issues for modpacks. I'm not helping any of you make a modpack. Don't think for a second you're gonna open an issue related to modpacks on my god awful creations thinking it's somehow their fault when you added a bunch of shit it wasn't designed for. Don't ask me for modpack help. Don't even make a suggestion relating to another modpack. I don't support any other modpacks. If I wanted compatibility for everything I'd say oh yeah this is for everyone, no, this is for Ragecraft and whatever other ecosystems I create in the future. Not you. 

As for plugins. This mod is intended to be a mod plugin. Not to be added on top of plugins. This mod is counter literally everything about plugins. It's intended to prove not only that
A. plugins are a pile of buggy garbage propped up by microslop but
B. that mods can do everything plugins can and then some without some janky server side only crap chute full of infinite errors and compatibility problems. 

This mod is literally the embodiment of hatred for everything 'normalized' by the minecraft community. Don't think for a second that anything this mod does will conform to your idiocratic demands. This is not a mod for plugins. This is not a mod for *your* modpack. This is a mod designed specifically for fixing labjac's and Bobcat's pile of crap to work with specific server requirements. Anything else is heresey and belongs on a cross.
